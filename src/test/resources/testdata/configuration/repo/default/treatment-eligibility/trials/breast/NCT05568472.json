	"description": "This phase III trial compares the effect of active symptom monitoring and patient education to patient education alone in helping young women with stage I-III breast cancer stay on their hormone therapy medicines.\nThe patient education tool contains interactive weblinks which provide patients with education material about breast cancer and side effects of therapy.\nSymptom monitoring is a weblink via email or text message with questions asking about symptoms.\nHormone therapy for breast cancer can cause side effects, and may cause some women to stop treatment early.\nAsking about symptoms more often may help women keep taking hormone therapy medicines.",
