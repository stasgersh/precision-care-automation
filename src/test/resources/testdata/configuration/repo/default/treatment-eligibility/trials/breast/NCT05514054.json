	"description": "The main purpose of this study is to measure how well imlunestrant works compared to standard hormone therapy in participants with early breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal receptor 2 negative (HER2-). Participants must have already taken endocrine therapy for two to five years and must have a higher-than-average risk for their cancer to return. Study participation could last up to 10 years.",
