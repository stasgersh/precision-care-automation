PLAN: Metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer currently on LHRH agonist. Overall he is doing well and has achieved
an undetectable PSA. We discussed the CHAARTED trial and the possibility of chemotherapy. He has low volume disease by
the study definition with the exception of possible rectal invasion. This was not proven as a colonoscopy was negative
for tumor infiltration into the bowel. Given this, his good response to ADT, and the lack of significant benefit seen in
patients with low-volume disease, I have recommended we proceed with ADT alone. The patient and his wife expressed
understanding and agreement. - RTC in 2 months w/ CBC, CMP, PSA and for his next triptorelin 50% of this 30 minute
consultation time was spent in patient's disease and treatment counseling. ___________________________________ **NAME[ZZZ]
