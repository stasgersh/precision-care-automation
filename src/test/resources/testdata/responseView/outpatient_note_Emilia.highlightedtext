The patient is a female in her 30s with a diagnosis of clinical stage IV invasive mammary carcinoma (IMC), no special type (NST), intermediate grade, low proliferative rate, ER/PR negative, HER2 positive, with lymphovascular invasion (LVI), right lymph node adenopathy, and liver involvement. Initial presentation included a persistent lump in the right breast and abdominal pain, leading to the discovery of hepatic lesions and a large right breast mass. A core biopsy confirmed the diagnosis, and a liver biopsy indicated metastatic mammary carcinoma. The patient was started on a regimen of Taxotere, Herceptin, and Pertuzumab, with Taxotere discontinued after a good response. She experienced an incidental uterine finding and pregnancy, which was terminated after counseling. The patient has been maintained on Herceptin and Pertuzumab with good response and no disease progression on recent MRI. Current complaints include increased back pain, managed with oxycodone and Tylenol. The plan includes continuation of Herceptin and Pertuzumab, with restaging in 9 weeks and a follow-up in 3 weeks.
