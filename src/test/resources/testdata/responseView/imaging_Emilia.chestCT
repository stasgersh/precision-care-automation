No abnormally enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes; several normal-sized nodes are present. 5. Heterogeneous liver lesions noted, with a small amount of air in the subcutaneous fat from a recent liver biopsy. 6. The heart, aorta, and main pulmonary artery appear normal, with no pericardial effusion or definite atherosclerotic calcifications. 7. The bones appear normal. Impression: 1.
