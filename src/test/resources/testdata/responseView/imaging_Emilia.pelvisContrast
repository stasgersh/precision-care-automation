The patient underwent a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast for restaging metastatic breast cancer and to rule out disease progression. The findings indicate no significant changes in the right breast mass, which remains ill-defined with diffuse skin thickening. Hepatic metastases in segments II, VI, and VII are stable, with no new lesions identified. The lungs show two subcentimeter nodules in the right lower lobe, unchanged since 2011, and a cluster of noncalcified nodules in the left lower lobe, also unchanged. The left adrenal mass remains stable at 3.4 x 1.7 cm since 2012. Metastatic disease in the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies is stable, with no new suspicious osseous lesions. The patient has bilateral, punctate, nonobstructing renal stones. No new lymphadenopathy or significant changes in other abdominal and pelvic organs were noted.
