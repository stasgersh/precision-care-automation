The patient underwent a CT Thorax Abdomen Pelvis with Contrast due to symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. The CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or any abdominal pathology. The lungs were clear, and the liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, small bowel, and large bowel were all normal. The pelvis was also normal with no fractures or inflammatory changes. The contrast agent enhanced the visualization of vascular structures, and no thrombus or embolus was detected in the pulmonary arteries. The impression is that the patient's symptoms are not due to pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or abdominal pathology. Further evaluation is recommended to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms.
