The patient has been diagnosed with peritoneal cancer and has responded to chemotherapy, but surgery was not performed. Regular follow-up scans every six months are crucial for monitoring the disease's progression or stability. The recent CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast shows no focal lung lesions, no pleural or pericardial effusion, and no central pulmonary embolism. The abdominal and pelvic organs appear stable, with no ascites or significant peritoneal disease. The largest lesion, a stable soft tissue nodule in the right paracolic gutter, has not changed in size. Additionally, there are no enlarged lymph nodes, and the solid organs show no signs of metastases. The conclusion of the scan indicates that the disease is stable, meaning there has been no significant progression or regression of the cancer. This is a positive outcome, suggesting that the current treatment plan is effectively managing the disease. Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure any changes are detected early and managed appropriately.
