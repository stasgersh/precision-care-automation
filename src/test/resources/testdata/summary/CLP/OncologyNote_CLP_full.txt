The patient is a female in her 30s with clinical stage IV invasive mammary carcinoma (IMC), no special type (NST), intermediate grade, low proliferative rate, ER/PR-negative, HER2-positive, with lymphovascular invasion (LVI), right axillary lymphadenopathy, and liver metastases, diagnosed on 04-22-2015. Initial symptoms included a persistent right breast lump noted in 09-2014, with subsequent imaging and biopsy confirming malignancy. A metastatic workup revealed liver involvement but no bone or other organ metastases. First-line systemic therapy with taxotere, herceptin, and pertuzumab (THP) was initiated on 05-17-2015, with taxotere discontinued after 8 cycles due to good response, and maintenance therapy with herceptin and pertuzumab (HP) continued. The patient experienced an incidental pregnancy during treatment, which was terminated after multidisciplinary counseling, and THP was resumed on 08-05-2015. She has since shown excellent response to therapy, with no evidence of disease progression on recent imaging. Current complaints include worsening lower back pain, attributed to musculoskeletal stiffness, for which pain management adjustments were recommended. Physical examination revealed right breast induration without a palpable mass, and laboratory results were unremarkable except for mild hyperglycemia. The patient will continue HP therapy, with restaging planned in 9 weeks and follow-up in 3 weeks.
