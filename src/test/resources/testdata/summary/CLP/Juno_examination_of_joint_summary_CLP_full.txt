The examination of the left shoulder joint under image intensifier revealed a maintained joint space with no significant effusion or swelling. A small fracture of the greater tuberosity of the humerus was noted, consistent with recent trauma. The rotator cuff tendons showed degenerative changes and a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon. The acromion and coracoid processes appeared normal, with no significant degenerative changes or fractures. Bone density was normal, with no signs of osteoporosis or other abnormalities. The impression is a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon and a small fracture of the greater tuberosity, likely due to recent trauma, with age-related degenerative changes in the rotator cuff tendons. Recommendations include continuing physical therapy, considering further imaging studies (MRI or CT scan), and possibly referring to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and treatment.
