The patient has experienced several significant oncological events since the last visit on 09-09-2007. On 01-31-2008, multiple biopsies were performed due to concerns of pyloric stricture and nodular appearance in the distal oesophagus. The pylorus biopsies revealed moderately differentiated carcinoma with occasional tumor nests in the lamina propria, displaying micropapillary architecture, and immunostaining indicated tumor cell expression of CA-125 and WT-1, consistent with metastatic ovarian serous papillary carcinoma. The oesophageal biopsies showed a partially collapsed oesophageal cyst with a bilayered lining and a fragment of ulcer slough material. Subsequent pathology reports on 02-01-2008, 02-02-2008, and 02-03-2008 confirmed these findings, with the pylorus biopsies consistently indicating metastatic ovarian serous papillary carcinoma and the oesophageal biopsies showing an oesophageal cyst with evidence of ulceration
